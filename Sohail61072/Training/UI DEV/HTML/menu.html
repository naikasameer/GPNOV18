<h2>Case 1: Dixons Carphone: >£70m Black Friday sales</h2>
<p>
    At the time, Fennell was Multichannel Director for Dixons Carphone (today he is Managing Director of subsidiary Carphone Warehouse). He knew the company was not capturing nearly as much business as it could on such a peak day, mainly because sub-optimal online customer experiences were limiting e-commerce sales.

Analytics clearly showed that the underlying issues included site functionality not optimised for buyers' journeys, slow site performance, and poor platform scalability and resilience.

But this knowledge wasn't what was really frustrating Fennell.
Not (just) an IT issue
Fennel's deeper frustration stemmed from the fact that although the company's commercial team knew what changes would transform the e-commerce experience for customers, the company was unable to deliver on the extensive change required.

The problem wasn't IT delivery capacity or skills. While it was true that there was a very large, wide-ranging portfolio of technology change to be achieved, Dixons had a team of around 175 developers based in Brno in the Czech Republic, all experienced in Agile delivery. But past experience had shown that despite this, the team struggled to deliver. Typical problems included:

Extended periods of requirements re-work, resulting in compressed delivery timescales.
Inadequate prioritisation of high-value change over low-value change.
Insufficient time for a high enough standard of testing.
In search of a solution

Fennell got together with Jake Hazeldine, Head of Applications, to find a solution.

Recognising that the issues probably weren't confined to the development team, they sought a consulting partner that would be able to understand and analyse not just IT delivery of major change projects, but the end-to-end process involving commercial and other organisational stakeholders, their objectives and their approaches.

Results:
1,100% rise in unique visitors
2,900% rise in orders
We were selected by Dixons for our recognised industry-leading expertise in Agile delivery (the delivery capability in the Czech Republic is Agile) allied to our broader capability in understanding upstream and downstream activity."

Eleven months after turning to IndigoBlue for help, Dixons had a transformed e-commerce platform in place and was ready for Black Friday. On the day, the company broke all records, achieving in excess of £70m sales from over 6,000,000 unique visitors.

The e-commerce platform remained stable and performed well under the massive increase in demand. Back-office and front-end systems and processes functioned without a hitch. Customers got their bargains, stakeholders were delighted, and Dixons reaped the revenue and PR benefits.

The UK national press recognised their success with headlines such as 'Currys break online record as Argos and Tesco websites struggle to cope with demand', and reported a 1,100% rise in unique visitors for Currys PC World and a 2,900% increase in orders compared with the same day in the previous week.
