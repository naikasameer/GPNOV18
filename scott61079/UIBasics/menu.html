                Contemplating the performance of his company's e-commerce platform during Black Friday — one of the most important shopping days in the calendar — Jeremy Fennell was frustrated.
                At the time, Fennell was Multichannel Director for Dixons Carphone (today he is Managing Director of subsidiary Carphone Warehouse). He knew the company was not capturing nearly as much business as it could on such a peak day, mainly because sub-optimal online customer experiences were limiting e-commerce sales.
                Analytics clearly showed that the underlying issues included site functionality not optimised for buyers' journeys, slow site performance, and poor platform scalability and resilience.
                But this knowledge wasn't what was really frustrating Fennell.
