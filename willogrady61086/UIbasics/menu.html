<p>Contemplating the performance of his company's e-commerce platform during Black Friday — one of the most important shopping days in the calendar — Jeremy Fennell was frustrated.
At the time, Fennell was Multichannel Director for Dixons Carphone (today he is Managing Director of subsidiary Carphone Warehouse).
